Easy-Script-Generator
GUI interface that allows users to create (export) scripts with no scripting knowledge. These scripts will help them run multiple computer programs or webpages (or both) from generated batch files. When the program is run, it will generate a .bat file that will execute all of the specified programs/web pages. That bat file will also have a .lnk shortcut created which will be placed on the user's Desktop and will allow them to double click the batch shortcut and execute multiple programs at once in order to save time in the long run.

Example Use Cases:

A user has 5 or 6 tabs that they log into everyday they go home (i.e. Facebook, Youtube, Gmail, and 2 reddit pages). This will allow them to double click a shortcut icon and open all tabs up at once. a. A future feature will be to fully log them into these as well.

Different types of needs. For instance, as stated above everyday leisure usage on a computer could be a generated script, but maybe a student has homework needs. This could open up their school email, Eclipse for a Java programming assignment, Microsoft Word for an essay or perhaps opening a specific document that they always need for homework such as a syllabus, and then finally Spotify for them to listen to music while they work.

Time is a precious resource, and should be better utilized not doing mundane tasks day in and day out.
